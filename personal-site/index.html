                    <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I fell in love with the internet in middle school. I got my MBA in e-Commerce from Westwood College of Technology so that I can persue a remote career as a family member in the Air Force. After 15 years in digital marketing, I decided to learn to code and become a freelance web developer making websites for small businesses.</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end developement, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code. </p>

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
